- Blur the lightmap based on distance to light sources


- Add noise/texture to the black walls everywhere
- Add nouse/texture to the lights? Some radial effects?
- Make light intensity fade at the edges



- Calculate SDF for the occluders
-- More accurate walls
-- More accurate shadows (~pixel perfect)
-- Ambient occlusion next to walls 
-- Use just one big level scoped texture for _everything_? Maybe rendered to some 4K texture?


- Add pure texture renderer for debugging
-- Input : texture
-- Rendering : Contents of the texture as is


- Add post processing effects
-- Bloom
-- Vignette
